    Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.<br> Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover<br> without requiring special treatment.
    Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like<br> cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.<br> The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well
    informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it<br> causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol<br> based rub frequently and not touching your face. <br> The COVID-19 virus spreads
    primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected <br> person coughs or sneezes, so itâ€™s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing <br> into a flexed elbow).<br> At this time, there
    are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19. However, there are many ongoing clinical<br> trials evaluating potential treatments. WHO will continue to provide updated information as soon as clinical<br> findings become available.
